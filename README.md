# Beagle-SDK-RN

Buiding a test DApp using React-Native.

1. Open a new project inside VSC. Then, use VSC’s terminal to clone the code using the “git clone” command followed by the above-copied HTTPS:

```
git clone git@github.com:Tomas-Shao/beagle-sdk-rn.git 
```

2. With the code cloned, make sure to go into the corresponding folder. Again, you need to use the VSC’s terminal:

```
cd beagle-sdk-rn
```

3. Next, you need to install all dependencies. As such, use the “yarn install” command in the terminal.
4. Now, you need to go to the iOS folder (type “cd ios” in the terminal). Once in the “ios” folder, run the “pod install” command in the terminal.
5. You need to return to the root folder. You do this by entering “cd ..” in the terminal’s command line.
6. For ios: "react-native run-ios"
7. For Android: "react-native run-android"
